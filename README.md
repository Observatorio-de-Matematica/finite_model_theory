# finite_model_theory
A Maxima package for finite model theory

This package uses Maxima's graph package to 
1) test whether a given graph is a model of a given first order formula
2) compute least and simultaneous fixed points of first order formulae on graphs
3. play Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games on graphs.
